% the mean firing rate over prefered trials is calculated and lowpass
% filtered (< 1Hz), its baseline was approximated by its mode value
% the time two points around the peak where the filtered mean signal drops
% below the threshold baseline +1/2 standard deviation are identified 
% the field size is given by the time interval between these two time
% points
% If the mean firign rate didnt drop below the value, the odor onset or
% delay offseet was used accordingly
% Field sizes >4 s were discarded

% field sizes should be considered as an approximation of the time interval 
% where the cell had the highest activation probability relative to the rest 
% of the trial, and as such its length represents the variability in 
% activation time for the cell.
